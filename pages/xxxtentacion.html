        XXXTENTACION - Jocelyn Flores
    </h2>
    <article class="description">
        <p class="text">
            XXXTENTACION, whose real name was Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy, was an American rapper, singer, and
            songwriter who gained popularity in the late 2010s. One of his most popular and emotional songs is
            "Jocelyn Flores," which was released on his debut studio album "17" in 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The song is named after Jocelyn Amparo Flores, a young woman who was a close friend of XXXTENTACION
            and had traveled with him to Florida before tragically taking her own life while visiting him.
            The song is a tribute to Flores and deals with themes of depression, suicide,
            and the struggles of mental health.

        <p class="text">
            "Jocelyn Flores" features a simple instrumental with a haunting piano melody and XXXTENTACION's
            signature raw and emotional vocal delivery. The lyrics of the song describe his emotions and feelings
            of guilt and sadness over Jocelyn's death, as he reflects on his own struggles
            with mental health and suicidal thoughts.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The song became a massive hit, reaching the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and charting
            in several other countries. It is considered one of XXXTENTACION's most significant and impactful
            songs and has been praised for its honest and raw portrayal of mental health struggles.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Sadly, XXXTENTACION was also tragically killed in a shooting in June 2018, which has
            added even more depth and meaning to "Jocelyn Flores" as a tribute to both him and his friend.
