            The lyrics of "Lucid Dreams" focus on Juice WRLD's heartbreak over a failed relationship and his

            which adds a melancholic tone to the track. Juice WRLD's emotional delivery and vulnerable lyrics resonated
            with listeners, especially younger fans who related to the themes of love and loss.
